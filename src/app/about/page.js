          <p className="mt-7">
            My name is Kia, and I am a passionate and creative woman dedicated to developing digital solutions that make a real impact. I have a background in Multimedia Design and Digital Concept Development, which has given me a strong foundation in mixing creativity with strategy to create meaningful experiences.
            I currently work at WonderWorks, a digital agency where I focus on marketing, web design, frontend development, and digital concepts.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4"> With years of experience in sales and customer service, I have gained valuable insights into communication, customer experience, and user needs. This allows me to approach every project with a deep understanding of how to create solutions that donâ€™t just look good but truly connect with people.
            I thrive in collaborative environments where different perspectives come together to build something greater, and I am always excited to take on projects that challenge me to grow.</p>
          <p className="mt-4"> I am currently looking for work or an internship where I can further develop my skills and contribute to creating digital solutions that are both visually compelling and functionally impactful.</p>
          <p className="mt-7 text-xl">Want to know more about me?</p>
